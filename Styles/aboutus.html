        <p>We are Off the pike, a student made and operated restaurant. We are from Arlington tech culinary class and we host a restaurant multiple
times a year. We are located at 816 S Walter Reed Dr, Arlington, VA 22204.

Off the Pike is an exceptional initiative orchestrated by the Arlington Career Center’s Culinary Arts program, providing students with unparalleled, experiential learning opportunities within the gastronomic and hospitality sectors. By operating a food truck and orchestrating ephemeral dining establishments, students are immersed in authentic industry environments, simultaneously generating financial support for the program. These events, convened biannually each semester, metamorphose the Career Center into a dynamic culinary venue for a singular evening, wherein students assume comprehensive responsibilities—including gastronomic conceptualization, meticulous food preparation, refined dining service, and strategic event promotion. The most recent Off the Pike pop-up restaurant event, held on December 14, showcased a meticulously curated menu featuring two salads, three entrées, two desserts, and four unlimited beverage selections. Approximately 34 students participated, representing about half of the entire Culinary program. The proceeds garnered, typically ranging from $1,000 to $1,500 per event, are reinvested into the program to augment educational resources and opportunities. Anticipating future endeavors, another Off the Pike pop-up restaurant event is slated for February, with the Off the Pike food truck resuming operations in the spring of 2024. Moreover, the Culinary Competition Team is poised to engage in various contests for scholarship awards from February through June. The Arlington Career Center community eagerly anticipates the innovative culinary experiences that these adept students will continue to contribute to Arlington.
